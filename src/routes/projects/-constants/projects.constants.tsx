        <p>
          I've always wanted to create a portfolio website, but lacked the
          inspiration for the design. I wanted a gimmick. I like film, and I
          just recently watched a{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC0HFwnK_5E&t=156s"
            target="_blank"
            className="underline"
          >
            YouTube clip
          </a>{" "}
          of the business card scene in American Psycho. So that was a start.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially I just had a white version of the center card, and that's
          it. Played around with some CSS rotations, some gimmicks with
          subtitles, but ended up scrapping a lot of the ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Took a break and visited Letterboxd, and found out that I could
          apparently export my personal data. And there it was, a CSV of all my
          liked films, complete with names and shortlinks to each of their
          Letterboxd film pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I built a webscraper using Playwright to automatically get each
          film's poster from their site. What better way of making your site
          pretty than using something that's already pretty. Made a carousel Ã 
          la netflix. Then hook up a window resize listener to check the number
          of carousels to render.
        </p>
        <p>
          Got some feedback that the posters were a bit too distractingly
          pretty, taking away attention from the important information (which
          was me).
        </p>
        <p>
          Played around with some CSS filters until I got a good combination of
          blur and grayscale to somewhat make them less eye catching, but with
          the carousel animation and different posters hopefully providing a
          nice texture to an otherwise boring site. However, that made me sad
          since the posters also warranted some love. So I brought back its
          liveliness on hover (interactivity++).
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted more though. I needed a reason for them to still go back to
          the card, as they hovering over the posters. Landed with the idea of
          using the CSS rotations again and using a library (
          <a
            href="https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/"
            target="_blank"
            className="underline"
          >
            color-thief
          </a>
          ) to get the color palette of the film poster, and applying that to
          the card.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dominant color on the front card, secondary colors for the succeeding
          cards behind it, then calculating contrast values to know if the text
          should be black or white. Then another contrast check among the
          secondary colors, but now against the chosen text color to use as a
          accent for the border and my name's shadow. I especially like how it
          turned out for Old Boy.
